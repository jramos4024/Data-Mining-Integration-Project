# Data-Mining-Integration-Project
This was a project I worked on for my Data mining class. The focus was on using pandas to train a classification model that could identify the genre of a song using 10+ attributes, the size of the dataset was over 100,000 songs and over 110 different genres. As expected, the basic models we were told to train only got up to 30% accuracy due to the size of the dataset and the many different genres it had to guess from.
