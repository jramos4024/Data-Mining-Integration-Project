# Song Genre Prediction Model Data Mining Project
Authors: Joe Ramos, George Alenchery, Vivian Procacci

Description: This project was developed as part of my Knowledge Discovery & Data mining course. The focus was on using pandas to train and evaluate classification models that could predict the genre of a song based on a set of over 10+ different audio and metadata features and attributes. The size of the dataset was over 100,000 songs and over 110 different genres. Due to the size and complexity of the dataset, baseline models achieved limited accuracy, which was expected and analyzed as part of the learning process.

Purpose: The purpose of this project was to apply data mining and machine learning techniques to a large, real world dataset. The project emphasizes data pre-processing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation, as well as understanding the limitations of basic classification models when applied to high dimensional data.

Technologies used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, google colab, Jupyter Notebook

Results: Due to the large number of possible genres and the complexity of the dataset, baseline classification models achieved only about 30% accuracy. This outcome aligns with expectations for introductory models applied to large scale multi class classification problems and was used to highlight the need for more advanced techniques.
